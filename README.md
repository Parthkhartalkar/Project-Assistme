# Assistme 
The Project Assistme, is a Python-based virtual assistant that can help us in everyday tasks like web-browsing, fetching news, playing music and more.
The project is not fully independent, Assistme requires user interaction to respond to our requests.
My goal was to gain hands-on experience with APIs, Python libraries and general programming logic.
